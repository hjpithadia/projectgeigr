# **projectgeigr**: The low cost radiation detector
====================================================
This project seeks to create a detector that is easy to operate, affordable 
and simple to construct. This purpose of this repo is to provide the source code
for the companion Android app for the detection unit.

The entire Android workspace has been cloned onto this repository, so essentially the 
app needs to be built and published into a .apk file before use.
